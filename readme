To-Do List Application (Python)
Project Overview

The To-Do List Application is a console-based Python program that allows users to manage tasks efficiently.
It supports adding tasks, viewing tasks, deleting tasks, and persists the data in a text file so tasks are saved even after closing the program.

Features

Add Task

Users can enter a task description.

The task is stored in a list in memory and also saved to tasks.txt.

Provides a confirmation message:

Task added ✅


View Tasks

Displays all tasks currently in memory.

Each task is numbered for easy reference:

Your Tasks:
1. Study Python
2. Do Homework


Delete Task

Users can delete a specific task by entering its number.

The task is removed from the list and the text file is updated to reflect this deletion.

Confirmation message example:

Task 'Do Homework' deleted 🗑️


Persistent Storage

All tasks are stored in tasks.txt.

On program start, the file is read to load previous tasks into the list.

Ensures tasks are not lost when the program exits.

How It Works

Start Program

Program opens tasks.txt (if it exists) and loads all tasks into a list.

User Menu

The program shows a simple menu:

1. Add
2. View
3. Delete
4. Exit


The user chooses an option by entering the corresponding number.

Add Task

User inputs a new task.

Task is appended to the list and saved to the file.

View Tasks

Displays all tasks with numbering.

If no tasks exist, shows a message:

No tasks yet!


Delete Task

Shows all tasks with numbering.

User enters the number of the task to delete.

Task is removed from the list and file.

Exit

Program stops. All tasks remain saved in the file.

Key Concepts Covered

Python Lists – storing tasks in memory.

File Handling – reading and writing tasks to tasks.txt.
